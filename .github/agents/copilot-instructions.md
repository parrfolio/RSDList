# RSD Wants Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: 2026-02-05

## Overview

RSD Wants is a Record Store Day checklist app for record collectors to browse the current year's RSD special releases, save items to a personal wants list, and check them off as acquired while shopping in-store.

## Active Technologies

- TypeScript (strict mode)
- React 18.3 + Vite + React Router
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives)
- lucide-react (icons)
- Zustand (UI state)
- TanStack React Query (server state)
- Firebase Auth (Google, Facebook, Email/Password)
- Firebase Firestore (with offline persistence)
- Firebase Cloud Functions (Node 20)
- Firebase Hosting + Emulators
- pnpm (flat project, not monorepo)
- Zod (validation)

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install              # Install all dependencies
pnpm dev                  # Start web + emulators + functions watch
pnpm lint                 # ESLint
pnpm typecheck            # TypeScript strict check
pnpm test                 # Run tests (optional)
pnpm seed:rsd             # Populate Firestore with release data
```

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode required
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for UI components
- All server state via React Query hooks
- All UI-only state via Zustand stores
- Optimistic updates for all mutations

### Core User Journeys

1. **Browse RSD Releases** - Anonymous users can browse current year releases in a grid, search by artist/title, sort A→Z or Z→A
2. **Sign In & Onboard** - Sign in via Google/Facebook/Email, select preset avatar on first login
3. **Add to Wants** - Signed-in users add releases to personal wants list with instant visual feedback
4. **Manage Wants/Acquired** - Check off items to move from Wanted to Acquired while shopping
5. **Account Management** - View profile, change avatar, sign out

### Key Entities

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Release | RSD special release (artist, title, album art, format, release type, label, quantity) |
| User | Authenticated user (uid, displayName, email, avatarId, authProviders) |
| Want | User's saved release with status (WANTED or ACQUIRED) |

### Firestore Collections

```text
/events/{eventId}            # RSD events (rsd_2025_spring, rsd_2025_fall)
/releases/{releaseId}        # Public releases (read-only to clients)
/users/{uid}                  # User profiles
/users/{uid}/wants/{wantId}   # User's wants (denormalized for fast reads)
```

### Routes

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/` | Redirect to `/rsd` |
| `/auth` | Sign in / sign up |
| `/rsd` | RSD release list (browsing) |
| `/mylist` | Wanted + Acquired sections |
| `/account` | Profile, avatar, sign out |

### shadcn/ui Components (required)

- button, card, input, badge, tabs, dialog, sheet
- dropdown-menu, avatar, checkbox, scroll-area
- separator, skeleton, toast (or sonner)

### App-Level Composed Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| ReleaseCard | Card + Button + Badge for release display |
| TopSearchSortBar | Input + DropdownMenu for filtering |
| BottomTabs | Mobile navigation tabs |
| SectionHeader | Separator + counts for list sections |
| EmptyState | Card + text + CTA for empty lists |

### Mobile UX Requirements

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Bottom tab navigation on screens < md breakpoint
- Touch targets ≥ 44px
- One-handed operation for My List checkboxes
- Firestore offline persistence for in-store use

### React Query Hooks

```typescript
useRsdReleasesQuery({ year, search, sort })  // Fetch releases
useMyWantsQuery({ year })                     // Fetch user wants
useToggleWantMutation()                       // Add/remove from wants
useSetWantStatusMutation()                    // Toggle WANTED ↔ ACQUIRED
```

### Zustand Store (UI State)

```typescript
interface UIState {
  viewMode: 'GRID' | 'LIST';
  year: number;
  sort: 'ARTIST_ASC' | 'ARTIST_DESC';
  search: string;
}
```

### Security Rules Summary

- Anonymous read allowed for `/rsdReleases`
- Auth required for all `/users` reads/writes
- Users can only access their own data (uid path match)
- Client writes to `/rsdReleases` denied
- Status field validated against WANTED | ACQUIRED enum

## Assumptions (MVP Scope)

- Both Spring + Fall RSD events supported
- Event IDs follow pattern: rsd_{year}_{season} (spring/fall)
- Current year releases only
- Preset avatars only (no upload)
- No per-item notes, priority, or budget tracking
- No social features (sharing, public profiles)
- Curated fallback dataset acceptable if scraping fails
